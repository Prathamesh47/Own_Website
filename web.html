        The Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay) today held Commencement 2024 at the Institute’s Convocation Hall. Mr. Natarajan Chandrasekaran, the Chairman of Tata Sons, the holding company and promoter of all Tata Group companies, was the
         Chief Guest and delivered the Commencement Address.

Commencement is a special event to be conducted once every year to gather all students expected to graduate in that academic year.

The Chief Guest Mr. Natarajan Chandrasekaran in his address spoke about three fundamental aspects – Trust, Character and Purpose that determine success in the  journey of building a career. He said, "Building and cultivating trust is very essential to your
 success. When an organisation and its colleagues trust you, they not only empower you but also embrace you. Secondly, Character is your capacity to prioritize your values over your instincts. It will enable you to be true to your principles. While trust 
 and character will help you to be successful in your career, the purpose that you live for will inspire and guide you and give you fulfillment,” he added.
